This is my simple and basic approach for finding the third largest integer in a array. Finding the third largest can be a lot complex when some numbers entered by user are similar. This code works for almost all the test cases (except if the user writes 89099 as second or third maximum) hahah.... but i think you can solve it by writing the biggest value possible for a integer which is infact +2147483647. No one can write beyond this number in a integer and if he writes that number, it will be stored in the first maximum which will not disturb the logic of the code.
I decided to share this code with you as when i was looking for it it was only available for distinct elements. So this code can stand absolutely tall in most complex cases like 5 5 5 4 2 when user enters some similar elements.
